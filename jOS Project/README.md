Welcome to Jormungandr Operating System (jOS). This repository contains an emulator for our Linux based OS written from scratch. Please visit the website linked in the repository to use an emulated version of the OS and to see a detailed technical writeup describing its features. Note, the emulation page was set up in a teammate's github hence why it says Jacob.
